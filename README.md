# SPA with users list

A simple React + TypeScript application created as a test project to demonstrate my skills. This app fetches and displays a list of users, provides detailed information for each user, and allows editing user data.

The project is deployed on Netlify and accessible via this link: https://cozy-pony-6b0d9a.netlify.app/

# Technologies Used

- **React** with **TypeScript** for building the UI.
- **Redux Toolkit** for state management.
- **React Router v6** for routing.
- **SCSS Modules** for styling.
- **Axios** for API requests.
- **Vite** for fast development and build.

# How to Run the Project Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ivakab/spa_with_users.git
cd spa_with_users
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the app in your browser:
